A simple Jump and Run Game in Javascript.

Check it out here:

## Keys for movement: 
    A  =  LEFT
    D  =  RIGHT
    S  =  DUCK
    SPACE  =  JUMP
Jump or duck to get past the barrels.
Try to pass as many barrels as possible, if you touch a barrel you lose 1 life out of 3.
After 3 lost lives it's game over.
After every 5 successfully passed barrels, the barrels become faster and the game more and more difficult.
If you leave the field, the barrels are not counted and will be deducted from you as soon as you re-enter the field.

Have Fun!
